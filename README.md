## Development
This library uses CRXJS to hot reload the extension during development. You'll need to enable developer mode in Chrome and load the unpacked `/dist` folder.

Start the development server using Vite:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Installation
Install the dependencies using PNPM, the package.json enforces the Node and PNPM versions:
```bash
pnpm install
```
